# TextMe

The TextMe is an online chat. You can log into the application, add a friend and start texting.

Some technologies used in this project: 

- ReactJS
- NestJS
- Socket.io


Note: The app is still using cache to save data. I'm working to add Prisma and SQLite (or other DB) to this application.
